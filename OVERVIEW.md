## 🏗️ Database Schema

### Models Implemented
1. **User** - Authentication and user management
2. **Category** - Ticket categorization
3. **Ticket** - Core ticket entity with status, priority, assignments
4. **Comment** - Threaded comments with internal note support
5. **Vote** - Upvote/downvote system with unique constraints
6. **Attachment** - File upload metadata
7. **AuditLog** - Ticket change tracking

### Relationships
- Users can own multiple tickets and comments
- Tickets belong to categories and can have many comments/votes/attachments
- Comments support parent-child relationships for threading
- Votes have unique constraints per user-ticket combination

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run development server
python run.py

# Access application
# Web interface: http://127.0.0.1:5000
# Default admin: admin@helpdesk.local / admin123
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Run API demonstration
python demo.py
```

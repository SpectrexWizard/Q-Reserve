# Initial database migration stub
# This file serves as a placeholder for future database migrations
# 
# In a production system, you would use Flask-Migrate to handle
# database schema changes over time.
#
# For this MVP, the database schema is created automatically
# by calling db.create_all() in the application factory.

# Example migration commands for future reference:
# flask db init
# flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
# flask db upgrade
